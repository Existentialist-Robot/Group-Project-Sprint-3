# Group-Project-Sprint-3
In this repository, we will be working through the [Kaggle Aerial Cactus Identification challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aerial-cactus-identification/) from 2019. The code here, accomplishes the following data science tasks:

- Pre-processing and dimensionality reduction with autoencoders
- Comparing dimensionality reduction between autoencoders and principle component analysis (PCA)
- Model selection and implementation with convolutional neural networks (CNN)
- Model interpretation with LIME
